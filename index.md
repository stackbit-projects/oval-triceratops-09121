### Hi, I'm Gareth ðŸ‘‹

This page is dedicated to my academic pursuits. I'm interested in the so-called "hard" questions of cognitive science. That is, how does the brain give rise to conscious awareness? What are the neural mechanisms that set humans apart from other animals? What do we mean by attention and what are the processes by which we allocate attention to things internally and to the outside world.
